Welcome to Car Crash Simulator 1000!

CCS is a one or two person game that aims to teach students physics through simulated car crashes. We include a variety of physical concepts involved in the study of motion and collisions like momentum, acceleration, velocity, and mass. 

CCS offers three distinct levels with different settings and cars that users can control with their WASD and arrow keys.

Note that player one (car closest to the bottom) is controlled via arrow keys and player two is controlled via WASD keys. Use the shift key closest to your respective movement keys to brake.

Beware the pedestrians! The person with the lowest score at the end of each round wins

Default Settings:
Mass = 10 kg
Acceleration (x,y) = 1 m/s^2
